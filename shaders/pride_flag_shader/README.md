![Screenshot](./screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

A shader to turn your Plane/Quad mesh into a pride flag! Works best if the mesh is subdivided (the shader includes a “wave” effect) and has an aspect ratio 2:1.

Currently supports 4 versions (represented by `flag_type`):
* Pride (“rainbow flag”)
* Trans
* Asexual
* Progressive pride
